 Misc scripts and tools for HS PS work
 + hs_alias_builder.sh - convert a CSV to the format of the alias portion of the share-update API call.
 + hs_find_by_vol.sh - Simple script that lists all volumes on a cluster then lets you search a share for files with instances on a selected volume.
 + vol_assim.sh is a script **written for a customer that needs to assimilate a large number of volumes into a single, or limited number of shares. Ver 0.1 is basic AF and needs more error checking. This is a logic run to make sure the overall process worked.**
